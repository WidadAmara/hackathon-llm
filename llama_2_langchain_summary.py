Having been often solicited, by my friends, to publish an account of
my travels and labors in the West, after much hesitation and doubt, I
have concluded to accede to their wishes. But before doing so, I will
say a little about my early life. Newburyport, Mass., is my native
place. My father, whose full name I bear, was from Denmark; my mother
from Amsterdam, Holland. I was the first born of a family of three
boys, one of whom, Frederick, many years since passed the way of all
the earth. The other, James, resides in Texas. My father was a sailor,
and was lost at sea in a terrific storm, when I was seven years old.
I have a faint recollection of seeing him two or three times, and the
only memento I have of him, is a large pitcher he had manufactured in
Liverpool with his name and the picture of a ship on one side, and my
mother’s maiden name and a picture representing Liberty, Peace and
Independence, on the opposite side. My mother was left in indigent
circumstances, with not a relative in the New World, save her three
helpless boys. She married some years after my father’s death, and
resided till her death, which took place two years since, in Princeton,
Mass. I have then a father, mother and one brother on the other side of
the river, and one brother on this side, and not many years can elapse
ere the whole family will be reunited in the land beyond the flood. I
well remember the spot where all of us once lived, although I have not
been in Newburyport for thirty years. It was on High street, between
the Court House and the residence of “Lord” Timothy Dexter. To me,
that street seemed a paradise, and it was, and still is, a magnificent
thoroughfare. It is on high ground, runs parallel with the Merrimac
river, overlooks the harbor, and is bordered with rows of grand
trees, with fine residences embowered in lawns and flower gardens.
In this charming locality, I spent the first decade of my life. Here
I ran, played, and frolicked with my brothers, and other little
associates. The Mall around the Court House, the pond in the rear, and
a neighboring cemetery, were places of frequent resort. On Sunday,
I attended Dr. Morse’s church, where, I am told, I was christened
by the good doctor, who was an Episcopalian. But the bud came near
being suddenly blasted. An old-fashioned cent which I put into my
mouth, slipped down my throat, and was extracted with much difficulty.
I distinctly remember the circumstance. When the copper was taken
out, blood flowed copiously from my mouth. My poor mother was much
frightened, and I suffered for a short time severely. If my father had
lived, I should probably have been a sailor. He was first mate of the
ship in which he made his last and fatal voyage, and was to have been
promoted to captain on his return. I have ever loved the sea, and a
ship is a thing of beauty in my eye. But it was written that the solid
earth, not the treacherous deep, should be the field of my operations.

One word about Lord Timothy, just referred to. He was a very eccentric
man, had many soft spots on his head, but knew enough to accumulate a
large fortune. He built a magnificent residence, which he adorned in a
very extravagant manner, with sculpture and pictures. He was very vain
of his house and wealth. It is said that a stranger, passing his house,
was attentively observing it, when Dexter, who was sitting at a window,
remarked: “Do you not think this is paradise?” “I should,” replied the
man, “if I did not see the devil at the window.” He was dubbed “Lord”
for his vanity and ostentation, and the title delighted him as much as
“Corsica” prefixed to Boswell, delighted the well known biographer of
that name.

I commenced attending school at an early age, but have no pleasant
memories of school-hours in my native town. My teacher would read a
chapter in the Bible, and make a long prayer every morning, and then
whip and pound his pupils till the time for his evening devotions. If
I escaped a day without two or three hard thrashings, I deemed myself
very fortunate, and I think I was as dutiful as school boys generally
were of my age. He was doubtless a believer in total depravity, and was
sure that nothing but blows and knocks would make a good impression on
our corrupt hearts.

From my tenth to my eighteenth year, I resided in Haverhill, Mass.,
with S. George. He was a farmer and shoemaker--made shoes in the
winter, and tilled the soil summers, and I worked on his farm and in
his shop, except winters, when I attended school. I remember my first
attempt at horseback riding. I went to live with him in the spring,
and he soon put me on a horse to ride when ploughing corn. The beast
was contrary and spirited. He would go like jehu a few rods, and then
stop short, and I would go over his head on to the ground. But I was as
spunky as the horse, and would scramble up, and tell Mr. G. to put me
on again. I was always eager to remount the beast, although he threw me
twenty times a day. Since then, I have rode over the Western country
horseback, and consider myself a good horseman.
